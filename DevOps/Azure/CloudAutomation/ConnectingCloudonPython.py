#To connect to the Azure Cloud using Python, you can use the Azure SDK for Python, which provides libraries to interact with various Azure services. Here's a basic example of how to connect to Azure and list the resource groups using Python:

#Install the Azure SDK for Python:
#Before you start, make sure you have the Azure SDK for Python installed. You can install it using pip:


from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.resource import ResourceManagementClient

# Initialize Azure credentials
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

# Initialize Resource Management Client
subscription_id = 'your-subscription-id'
resource_client = ResourceManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

# List resource groups
print("Resource Groups:")
for resource_group in resource_client.resource_groups.list():
    print(f"- {resource_group.name}")
#Replace 'your-subscription-id' with your Azure subscription ID.


# This script will authenticate with Azure using your credentials and list the resource groups in your subscription.
